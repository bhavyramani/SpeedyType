Life is something that requires a considerable amount of Physical and Mental effort. 
Some are fortunate enough to have everything prepared for them. 
Such as some are born into money and some come across good fortune yet most work hard 
from the start to get some where in the world. 
It just all depends on how you were brought into this world. 
For some people life is full of stress and hardships. 
That is how life was for someone very dear to me. 
STRUGGLE teaches the value of hard work and dedication. 
Children Develop THE CONFIDENCE to deal with the challenges that are a NATURAL 
part of life. 
Growth mindset also builds resilience and a love of learning, which are necessary 
for Innovation and Accomplishment. 
You learn a lot about yourself when you struggle. 
It is a chance to learn how to use Failure. 
When people go through struggles it makes them Emotionally stronger. 
Struggle is central to our life force and beauty. 
Without it the world is a dull gray. 
And yet most of us are given to naturally avoiding struggle or worse and 
spending our lives in an attempt to Vanquish it  in search of PEASE and EASE. 
Just look at all the useless shit we invent and buy in order to make LIFE easier. 
Every perceptual limit that we survive and surpass opens a new world 
of possibility to us. 
That is because most LIMITS exist only in our minds.
