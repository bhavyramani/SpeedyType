Sir Isaac Newton said, "If I can see a little further it is by standing on the 
shoulders of giants," it's not the outcome that matters, or the size of the trial, 
but rather the quality of our engagement with the world that matters. 
Stephen Hawking was born on January 8, 1942 in Oxford, England, UK. 
Hawking studied physics at University College, Oxford (B.A., 1962), 
and Trinity Hall, Cambridge (Ph.D., 1966). 
He was elected a research fellow at Gonville and Caius College at Cambridge. 
Hawking's contributions to physics earned him many exceptional honours. 
In 1974 the Royal Society elected him one of its youngest fellows. 
He became professor of gravitational physics at Cambridge in 1977, 
and in 1979 he was appointed to Cambridge's Lucasian professorship of mathematics, 
a post once held by Isaac Newton. 
His father was Frank Hawking, an English biologist; his mother was Isobel Walker, 
a Scottish Philosophy, Politics and Economics graduate; 
both parents were graduates of the University of Oxford. 
"A mountain-sized black hole would give off X-rays and gamma rays, at a rate of 
about 10 million megawatts, enough to power the world's electricity supply." 
"Remember to look up at the stars and not down at your feet". 
Try to make sense of what you see and wonder about what makes the universe exist. 
The greatest enemy of knowledge is not ignorance, it is the illusion of knowledge. 
It surprises me how disinterested we are today about things like physics, 
space, the universe and philosophy of our existence, our purpose, 
our final destination. 
Its a crazy world out there, Be curious.
